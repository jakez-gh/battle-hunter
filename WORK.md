# Battle Hunter — Work Board

Active sprint, pending backlog, and completed milestones.
Agents: mark your task `IN_PROGRESS` in a commit before starting — prevents conflicts.

---

## How to pick up work

1. `git log --oneline -5` — see what just landed
2. `node --test` — confirm baseline green
3. Find the top `[ ]` item below, change it to `[~]`, commit "chore: claim NAME"
4. Do the work, tests green, commit with SHA, mark `[x]`

## Sprint: Project Scaffolding (enterprise-ready tracking)

Goal: give every agent — including agents months from now — enough context to
orient, pick up the right work, and make sound decisions without re-reading the
entire codebase. The ladder: `CLAUDE.md` (orientation) → `ARCHITECTURE.md` (why
it's shaped this way) → `WORK.md` (what to do right now) → `docs/decisions/`
(load-bearing choices). For multi-slice initiatives, promote items to `ROADMAP.md`.

### Done (2026-06-17)

- [x] **CLAUDE.md** — quick-start, file ownership tables, sprite system docs,
  operating model (ad-hoc vs initiative lanes), fresh-agent bootstrap order,
  research & ADR convention. `436b06e`

- [x] **WORK.md** — sprint board with claim-before-start convention, pending/done
  separation, backlog. `436b06e`

- [x] **.claude/settings.json** — PostToolUse hook: runs `node --test` after every
  file edit so regressions surface immediately. `436b06e`

- [x] **ARCHITECTURE.md** — module boundary rules, state model, screen stack, board
  generation, rendering pipeline, gotchas. Living doc.

- [x] **docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md** — ADR template: question / options / research /
  decision / why / consequences.

- [x] **ADR-001** — no build step (why static ES modules, not Vite/esbuild).

- [x] **ADR-002** — deterministic engine + seeded RNG (why, what it enables, constraints).

- [x] **ADR-003** — string-grid sprites + IP constraint (why not PNGs, trade-offs).

### Pending

- [ ] **ROADMAP.md** — needed when the backlog grows beyond ~5 independent items.
  Currently unnecessary; promote this item if a multi-slice initiative (network
  play, replay mode) is greenlit. Format: epics with goal + acceptance criteria +
  phase breakdown.

- [x] **ADR-004: hunter record vs ref** — `docs/decisions/004-hunter-record-vs-ref.md`.
  `f606061`

## Sprint: Visual Polish

### In Progress

none — claim one from the next section

### Visual polish pending

none — claim one from the backlog

## Completed milestones

- [x] **Wall tile sprite** — stone-block face (mortar joints, staggered blocks)
  replaces blank wall cells. `tile.wall` in sprites.js, renderer updated.
  Commit: `6f14fba`

- [x] **Battle UI restyle** — red border, inner accent, "B A T T L E" title bar,
  ATTACKER/DEFENDER labels. `renderer.js drawBattle`.
  Commit: `6f14fba`

- [x] **Modern UI pass** — font swapped from Courier New → Consolas stack; box()
  redesigned with gradient fill + single top-edge highlight, no corner squares;
  HP bars use top-to-bottom gradient (bright→dim per health tier).
  Commit: (this session)

- [x] **Pit tile** — near-black void tile with mortar-joint hint. `sprites.js`. Already landed before audit.

- [x] **Title screen music** — `enter()` calls `app.music('title')`. Already landed before audit.

- [x] **HOW TO PLAY content audit** — fixed monster IDs (OOZ/VAC not BRO/RAD), counter item
  names (Patch/Repellent/Override/Tamer), Calmant/Releaser, Wardstone spawning note.
  Commit: `bd6c0c9`

- [x] **Item effect icons** — `itemName()` appends `+N` tier tag for weapon/armor/escape items;
  HUD INFO panel uses `itemName()` for consistency. Commit: `f606061`

- [x] **Title screen parade** — 8 hunters (was 4), diamond decorations on separator.
  `screens.js drawTitle`.
  Commit: (session 2026-06-17)

- [x] **Mission briefing screens** — all 15 missions have narrative + objective hint.
  `screens.js makeMissionBriefingScreen`.
  Commit: `728a493`

- [x] **9-page HOW TO PLAY manual** — paginated, dot-pager navigation.
  `screens.js makeManualScreen`.
  Commit: `728a493`

- [x] **AI speed slider** — default 8×, options 1–64, `[`/`]` in-game.
  Commits: multiple sessions

- [x] **Escape pause menu** — Resume / Return to Hub from in-game Escape.
  `screens.js GAME onKey`.

- [x] **HUD goal box** — shows actual item name for fetch, rescue hold countdown.
  `screens.js drawHud`.

- [x] **Engine faithfulness fixes** — blue E-warp, green trap, panicked AI takeover,
  WYRM mission-end, escape item bonus (Slick Boots/Jumpsuit/Longcoat), and more.
  Commits: `5124314`, `414e778`

- [x] **Engine bug fixes** — defeatHunter panic clear, applyEndTurn hunter kind guard.
  Commits: `043ada3`, `7f90e77`

- [x] **Performance/feel** — event durations −40%, AI async from render queue.
  Commits: `7417067`, `36d6f66`

## Sprint: Fun & sellability (from multi-agent design analysis, 2026-06-20)

Goal: make the game genuinely more fun and worth paying for. Direction from the
analysis: polish the existing turns to feel sharp/fair/watchable, then build a
seeded roguelike "Relic Dive" run + "Daily Hunt" (the deterministic engine makes
it cheap). Quick wins first — every one lifts the floor of *every* mode.

### Done (2026-06-20)

- [x] **Steering range + path overlay** — wire the renderer's already-built
  `showRange`/`showPath` (drawn but never fed) into `turn.steer` via
  `adapt.steerOverlay`. Turns blind steering into a readable tactical decision.
  Commit: `5c5083a`

- [x] **One-step soft-undo while steering** — Z / Backspace rewinds the last
  step (no die re-roll); snapshot-based, relies on engine purity (new game.test
  invariant). Antidote to "died to a hidden trap I couldn't see." Commit: `1ac3d2b`

### Quick wins pending (days-to-weeks, low-regret — see analysis)

- [~] **Crush AI dead-air** — `aiSpeed` exists (default 8) but the per-substep
  gate is uniform. Make non-decisive substeps (plain walk/draw/rest) near-instant
  (~50–80ms); keep full ceremony only for battles / target-found / flag-6 /
  WYRM-spawn. Surface the speed control (keys `[`/`]` are undiscoverable).
- [ ] **Dice fairness without removing dice** — pre-attack advantage readout
  (stat delta), one **Fortune reroll token** per hunter per mission, post-battle
  math summary. Story/display-only fudging is OK; never touch Normal/seeded RNG.
- [ ] **AI uses the dodge/crit-negate reflex** — replace hardcoded `{hit:false}`
  in `ai.js` with a difficulty-scaled seeded roll; add Easy/Normal/Hard at setup.
- [ ] **Combat juice micro-pass** — rolling damage counter, crit freeze-frame,
  magnitude-scaled audio pitch; dedicated WYRM-spawn cinematic (clip-worthy).
- [ ] **Rival voice** — 10–20 short lines for Keld/Mira/RAVEN on found-target /
  defeated / steal / WYRM. Cheap characterization; shows up in reviews.
- [ ] **Hotseat hidden-hand fix** — render the active player's hand + a
  pass-the-device handoff card (4-player Normal is currently unplayable).

### Big bet (weeks-to-months): "Relic Dive" seeded run + Daily Hunt

Phase hard; prove each phase is fun before funding the next. Promote to
`ROADMAP.md` when greenlit.

- [ ] **Phase 0 — Determinism cleanup (prerequisite).** Route every
  gameplay-affecting entropy source through the seeded rng. Known leaks:
  `main.js` `Math.random()` for opponent archetypes/AI names/sprite IDs/the seed
  itself; `screens.js` dungeon-music pick. Acceptance: seed-replay equality test
  passes. Nothing seeded/shareable is honest until this lands.
- [ ] **Phase 1 — Depth-stack + Daily Hunt** (chained seeded dungeons of rising
  relicLevel; "Descend or Bank Out"; date-seeded daily + local best/streak +
  share string). Keep a "Classic Campaign" wrapper.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Horizontal perks** (choose-1-of-3 between depths, same
  effect-string format `items.js` already parses; breadth not vertical power).
- [ ] **Phase 3 — Run modifiers + per-depth room objectives.**
- [ ] **Deferred** — cloud leaderboard + ghost races (needs a backend = new
  external resource; only after the offline daily proves return visits).

## Backlog (future sprints)

- Network play (WebRTC or WebSocket) for remote multiplayer
- Replay/spectate mode (engine is deterministic; save action log + seed)
- Additional board sections (currently 14; more variety = less repetition)
- Sound effect for each item use type
- High-score leaderboard (localStorage, top-10 per mode)
- Accessibility: keyboard nav on all menus, colour-blind palette option
